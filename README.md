# Human Safety App (SafeShake)

A **Flutter + Firebase** safety app that shows live location on Google Maps, warns if you enter predefined **danger zones**, and lets you **triple-shake** your phone to quickly open the dialer to call the nearest police station (via Google Places API). If no station is found, the app falls back to **999** (you can change this to your countryâ€™s emergency number).
